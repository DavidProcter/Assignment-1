Assignment 1 for ENGG1003 S1-2019, Cipher System

For ease of use, each cipher (rotation, substitution) uses the same file for input and output.

These can be created by doing a manual input for text and key.

Files: rotation_text.txt, substitution_text.txt

The no key decryption also uses it's own file, see on screen instructions.

File: rotation_nokey_in_text.txt
